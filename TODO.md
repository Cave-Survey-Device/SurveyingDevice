# TODO
## Test magnetometer
1. Finish stripboard and run test to view raw data, maybe try arduino plotter


## Test accelerometer
1. Write driver for SCA3300-D01-1
2. Add to stripboard and test


## Test acceleromter and magnetometer with known data
1. Use rig with 3 axis rotation equiped with inclinometer and compass to test sensors

## Test alignment of accelerometer and magnetometer
1. Write alignment algorithm in sensorhandler
2. Run alignment test, check for known position via 3-axis rig

## Test laser alignment
1. Re-attempt laser alignment tests now that all other sensors are known to be functional and aligned
